<title>Saving your password</title>

<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>It can get annoying to enter your user:pass every time you push to github.com.. There are two options to save your password</p>

<h1>Insecure permanent method</h1>
<p>This method should only be used if you are the only one who has access to your computer and repository. This is because the password is stored in plain text.</p>
<p>In your repository navigate to the /.git/config file.</p>
<p>Open this file and edit the [remote "origin"] url line:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">[remote "origin"]
url = https://username:password@github.com/username/repositoryname.git</pre></div>

<p>So the only part you add is the username:password before the @ sign.</p>
<p>If you run <code>git remote -v</code> you can see your user:password. So this is not a secure method to use.</p>

<h1>Secure temporary method</h1>
<p>Run the following in your repository directory:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">
<span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=<span class="green">3600</span>'</span></pre></div>
<p>Change the timeout= to any amount of seconds you like.</p>
<p>This caches your password after you enter it the first time for the number of seconds you set.</p>
<p>It also creates a file named .gitconfig in your shell user's directory with the following content:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">[user]
        name = John Smith
        email = john.smith@example.com
[credential]
        helper = cache --timeout=3600</pre></div>
