<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Git is a free and open source version control system, originally created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. It's regularly used by software developers to share and work on code in an organized format. All changes are stored in revisions so a full history of file changes is always available. Git is also often used with github.com to store files online.</p>
